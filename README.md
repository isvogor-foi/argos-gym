## ARGoS GYM
This project is a playground environment for testing OpenAI Gym with ARGoS multi-physics swarm robot simulator. This is under heavy development. Ongoing goals:
 - Create a general OpenAI Gym Environment that works well with ARGoS Footbot robot
 - Hookup Gym with ARGoS (enable sending commands to robots, receive feedback from robots)
 - Use Keras to perform "smart stuff"
